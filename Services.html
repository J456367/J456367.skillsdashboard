     Database Management Systems and Data Structures
    </h2>
    <p>
     The following are two assessment excerpts from my databases Architecture course. I take the
                   opportunity to discuss two topics. The first is ACID and BASE Architectures, the second the scaling
                   methods of databases architectures.
    </p>
    <h3>
     ACID and BASE Architectures
    </h3>
    <p>
     Relation Database Management Systems also know as RDBMS typically follow the ACID principle which
                    stands for atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability. The ACID database methodology is
                    reliable and consistent. However that comes at a cost of complex implementation and higher costs as
                    the system grows. Also to note potentially longer search times. This in contrast with the BASE
                    principle which is seen more often in the big data space. BASE stands for basically available,
                    soft state and eventually consistent. BASE database systems are a choice is it is not absolutely
                    necessary for the end users to see the exact same information and the information can be stored
                    in a unstructured format.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ACID database architecture are commonly seen and used in systems. The A in ACID for Atomicity
                    reflects that if a change in one database transaction has an effect on a other the operation will
                    only take place if both adjustments are completed. An example would be in banking, a deposit from
                    one account to another. In this instance the database is designed so that money is not taken out
                    unless there is confirmation that it has been updated in the receiving account. Consistency for C in
                    ACID also known as correctness means that the exchange of data must follow constraints and triggers
                    for a successful data adjustment. For some industries this is vital for the success of a given
                    system. Banking being an example. Isolation for I in ACID means that the information being adjusted
                    must be isolated when making changes. This means the information is locked when changes are being
                    made. Finally Durability which means that the database system has preventative measures which will
                    stop critical information being lost or adjusted is parts of the architecture are not operating
                    correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
     BASE databases are seen in distributed systems. The information may not always be the most recent
                    addition, hence the BA in BASE is basically available, basic operations like reading and writing are
                    designed to be consistently available. The S in BASE stands for Soft State, this means that after a
                    period of time since the modification to the data we can expect to be viewing the most recent
                    information. The E in base stands for Eventual Consistency, this means that after a period of time
                    we can expect the database clusters to all show the same information.
    </p>
    <p>
     With an understanding of the requirements of a system a BASE or ACID or hybrid solution can be
                    implemented. Asking questions like what is the purpose on the data and how important is it that the
                    information is consistent alongside infrastructure or computation resources and costs limitations
                    are in place will help define the best data architectural practices.
    </p>
    <h3>
     To Multi-Master or not to Multi-Master - that is the question
    </h3>
    <p>
     Looking at whether or not to move an organisation to a multi-master database architecture or look
                    towards other architectural practises will require an analysis or the business requirements
                    alongside the budgeting. So in order to help make this decision the following will discuss the
                    potential database scaling methodologies. This will cover a few main points including vertical
                    scaling, implementation of read only replicas, multi-master, multi-tenant a hybrid database
                    architecture including ACID and BASE technologies and finally looking towards the implementation of
                    moving to cloud or running a hybrid cloud approach. Finally the consideration to optimize the
                    database remove unnecessary information and data cleansing.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first topic for discussion is vertical scaling instead of a multi master approach. This includes
                    would result in upgrading the hardware which hosts the master database. CPU's running at higher GHZ
                    with more Cores and multiple threads. One option would be to look at the memory, the memory could be
                    improved to a card that is DDR3 to DDR4 if the motherboard allows. This would result information
                    being recalled from memory, secondly the amount of memory called be increased depending on the
                    limitations of the motherboard. Finally if hard-drives and being used they could be replaced with
                    Solid State Drives. The combinations of all these vertical scaling options could be used instead of
                    the multi-master option.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another option is to minimize the data read on the master and instead have read only replicas. This
                    had the potential to reduce the strain on the master database. While the read only replicas could be
                    scaled depending on computational requirements. This could result in commodity hardware being used
                    for parts of the database architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Multi-Master approach could work with commodity hardware however from an engineering and
                    architectural perspective it could be more expensive to build out and maintain from the perspective
                    of labour costs. That being said a multi-tenant approach could potentially work dependant on the
                    business requirements. It would result in the business being split into sections. Where each part of
                    the business has it's own master database and unique database architecture.Another consideration of
                    a hybrid approach of ACID and BASE systems. The master could still be ACID but certain information
                    could be moved to a BASE system freeing up space and computation resources.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally to note the option of Data Cleansing and restructuring the information architecture. This
                    could have a drastic effect on performance. Moving old information to an achieve. Looking towards
                    more efficient ways to index and store information and minimizing data replications wherever
                    possible.
